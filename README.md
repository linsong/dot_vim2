dot_vim2
========

This is a new repository based on [dot_vim](https://github.com/linsong/dot_vim). Yes, this is a another vim configuration repository with a new plugin manager [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Why I switch from [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) to Vim-Plug because Vim-Plug is more lightweight, faster to download plugins. 

And the old repository become bloated after several days, I create a new one to get rid of many outdated plugins, lazy load some plugins that are not daily used. By this way, vim starts up very quickly, and I hope to keep it as quickly as possible in future. 

Hope this new repository will make your life easier, too. Happy Vimming!
